# fortyTwo-Menu
A little menubar application for Mac OS 10 to:

* toggle visibility of hidden files
* display the most memory-consuming active applications
* basic info on current network status


Thanx to the great swift/cocoa tutorials by

This app might not be ready for production use - no guarantees whatsoever.

All errors are mine...
